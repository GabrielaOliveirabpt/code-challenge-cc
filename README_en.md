# Clear Canvas Frontend Test 2019

This is a basic frontend test to show us your frontend skills.

## Getting started

* We've included a mobile and a desktop screen design in the `/design` folder.
* We prepared the html code for the example in the index.html file.
* You'll find the assets in the `/assets` folder.


## Comments

* This is a git-repository – please feel free to use it to commit your changes
* Please don't use JavaScript frameworks (angular, react, vue...)
* It's not important to deliver a pixel perfect result
* You're allowed to change the html code to deliver a better result or to make things easier
* Feel free to add animations (for example when opening the mobile menu)
* You don't have to check all different browsers – we're using a modern Chrome browser to check your results
